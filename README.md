Directiory Map
------------------------------
this is a collection of fun scripts and expirements regarding go Lang and unconventional usage



Windows SH Injection
- A windows shell script injector. You need to encrypt a SH payload with the given encrypter and bind it to the stub

WIP Mac
- mem execution using a shadow file

WIP Lin
- setting up a daemon process directly from memory 

WinSHStubOnline[test]
- Running a remote encrypted file directly from memory

changeDaWorld
- embedded mp3 data and a self deleting file


How to build
------------------------------ 
mac & linux stub coming soon 

windows stub:
> GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build Stub-win.go 

binder:
> go build binder.go 

Encrypt:
> go build encrypt.go

Decrypt:
> go build decrypt.go

How to use 
------------------------------ 
Encrypt your Shellcode payload -(PAYLOADSH is already encrypted dont encrypt it twice)
> ./Encrypt -file PathToShellCode


Bind the files
> ./binder -first Stub-win.exe -second PayloadSH -output test.exe

Decrypt
> ./Decrypt -file PathToShellCode


NOTE
------------------------------ 
if you change anything in the stub make sure you build first and then adjust the the bytes to skip var as it needs to know how many prepeneded bytes to skip. 

PayloadSH is the shellcode of Payload.go (Payload.exe) IT IS ALREADY ENCRYPTED
